## Opening Remarks

This is a continuously updated list of articles, blog posts, tweets, videos, books, albums, pictures, you name it — random things that I've found somehow thought-provoking or even world-shaking lately.

The list is one window to my soul landscape, and maybe one day, we can see how my world has changed over time - or then not. 😄

The list runs in reverse chronological order; the last item added is found first in the list.
