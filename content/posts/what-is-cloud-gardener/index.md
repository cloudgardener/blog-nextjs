You may have a clue as to what I'm trying to present with this title, but do you want to hear the whole story?

> “Rather than construction, programming is more like gardening—it is more organic than concrete.” — The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas

That is very aptly said and made me smile very broadly. As today's cloud infrastructure is an ever-increasing extent software and code, why can I not adopt this metaphor? — So I did, and this is how I got a new great title and name for this blog.

Ok, I must confess that it is also a little slap on the wrist for all the people taking their titles too seriously. :)

p.s. A new revised 20th Anniversary Edition of The Pragmatic Programmer is now available [here](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition). I'm going to read it, how about you?

Sincerely yours,
your Cloud Gardener,
